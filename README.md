1. What is Logging?
Logging is the process of recording events, messages, or other information about the operations and activities of a computer system or software application. Logs typically contain timestamps, severity levels, and specific messages that provide insight into system behavior and user interactions. They are crucial for monitoring, debugging, and auditing purposes.

2. Why Logging is Important
Logging is important because it helps:

Troubleshoot Issues: Logs provide detailed information that can help identify and resolve system errors or malfunctions.
Monitor System Performance: By tracking system activity, logs help in assessing performance and identifying potential bottlenecks.
Enhance Security: Logs can detect unauthorized access attempts and other security incidents.
Ensure Compliance: Many industries require logging to comply with regulatory standards, ensuring data integrity and transparency.


3. Understanding Logging Levels
Logging levels indicate the severity or importance of messages recorded in logs. Common logging levels include:

Debug: Detailed information for diagnosing issues, usually turned off in production.
Info: General operational messages that confirm the system is working as expected.
Warning: Indications of potential problems that aren't immediately harmful.
Error: Serious issues that have occurred, impacting functionality but allowing the application to continue running.
Critical/Fatal: Severe problems that may lead to application termination.
